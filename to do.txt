-to figure out how to save simulations
-to figure out how to save plots
-to store simulations results in a separate folder
-to save only spike times and minimal voltage for each interval + save plots of phase plane  and voltage trace in separate folders
-to check axis, labels etc.
-to make it possible to save all images together at once (for now it's ok to save only histograms)
-check if threshold is ok for different parameters - seems so
?to continue working with hists. Burst ISIs have the peak in the beginnig
-divide quiet ISIs into parts. look if we can neglect going to node time.
-axis, labels! min_volt_hist. node instead of min?
-J.-H. will give me a new 2D model. plot everything for it - see what happens!
-Rewrite everything with tau_n as a parameter, maybe it's the problem!
 No, timestep was the prolem

-------------------------------------------------------------
-Simulate more data. Think about ISI division. Talk to J.-H. on monday



-Spykeviewer

-to think what tau value for noise is reasonable. noise current mean could be bigger then what I'm using
