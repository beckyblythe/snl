-to figure out how to save simulations
-to figure out how to save plots
-to store simulations results in a separate folder
-to save only spike times and minimal voltage for each interval + save plots of phase plane  and voltage trace in separate folders
-to check axis, labels etc.
-to make it possible to save all images together at once (for now it's ok to save only histograms)
-check if threshold is ok for different parameters - seems so
?to continue working with hists. Burst ISIs have the peak in the beginnig
-divide quiet ISIs into parts. look if we can neglect going to node time.
-axis, labels! min_volt_hist. node instead of min?
-J.-H. will give me a new 2D model. plot everything for it - see what happens!
-Rewrite everything with tau_n as a parameter, maybe it's the problem!
 No, timestep was the prolem
-approx separatrix doesn't work!
-Plot limit cycle and node and saddle as points.
--dependency!!! saddle on get_points, but find_points on saddle
Do not exactly node, but some area around it
-Simulate more data. Think about ISI division. Talk to J.-H. on monday
-to plot fraction of quiet as a function of tau, I. Maybe even distribution of burst in a row.
-try to find parameters, so that overall distribution looks bimodal!

-1000 multiplication for histograms. somehow needed for 153 1, check why. fix

-Spykeviewer. something doesn't work. maybe it's about units. check it.
-why with new dt I'm getting weird stuff close to zero in burst_ISIs?
-Think about the title and the abstract
-------------------------------------------------------------
simulate 50 neurons for suspicious/not enough data araeas!!!!!



-look at Jan-Hendrik's code

-Compare properly new results to old results
-Running simulations now with noise 2.5. maybe we can actually see proper bimodal stuff

-can it be nicely bimodal to the left from the bifurcation? (so that quiet ISI dominate, are the default regime)

-maybe fix the plotting. now it's really not obvious when and what is plotted!

-phase portrait. something is still wrong. arrows don't go to the limit cycle

Example pictures are for parameters: tau_n = .1575*ms
					Iapp =2.3 * uA #/cm**2
					I_noise = 2.5*uA



!!!!!!
To include number of neurons in file name. 155 1.1 - 10 neurons
old timestep - new timestep
zoom in initial segment of the histogram
To clean the code
To run stuff for bigger timestep

Bimodal!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!





-to think what tau value for noise is reasonable. 


//////////
Noisy dynamics of a neuron with co-existing spiking and resting states.


It is known that transition between resting and spiking states of a single neuron is in some cases associated with an emergence of a limit cycle and simultaneous disappearance of a resting state equilibria (e.g. saddle-node on invariant circle bifurcation). We study a two-dimensional conductance based neuron model, which under certain parameters range has co-existing stable limit cycle and stable node, i.e. resting and spiking states exist at the same time. This can be reached through saddle-node loop (SNL) bifurcation (also known as saddle homoclinic orbit bifurcation) with a change of different parameters. In this work we use the time constant of potassium conductance. As we assume a noisy input to the neuron, the system can switch between resting and spiking states and thus execute different spiking patterns. We study transition between the patterns, show how different spiking timescales might be and try to compare dynamics generated by the model with recordings from hippocampal CA3 pryramidal neurons.
