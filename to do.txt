-to figure out how to save simulations
-to figure out how to save plots
-to store simulations results in a separate folder
-------------------------------------------------------------

-to save only spike times and minimal voltage for each interval + save plots of phase plane  and voltage trace in separate folders

-check if threshold is ok for different parameters
-to check axis, labels etc.


-to make it possible to save all images together at once (for now it's ok to save only histograms)
