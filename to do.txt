-to figure out how to save simulations
-to figure out how to save plots
-to store simulations results in a separate folder
-to save only spike times and minimal voltage for each interval + save plots of phase plane  and voltage trace in separate folders
-to check axis, labels etc.
-to make it possible to save all images together at once (for now it's ok to save only histograms)
-check if threshold is ok for different parameters - seems so

-------------------------------------------------------------

-divide quiet ISIs into parts. look if we can neglect going to node time.


-division is so messy! to rewrite when in good shape 

-to do str(weights) ordered right. now - 0.5 0 1
-is it possible to open existing pictures when parameters are called?
-to change try except to if

-maybe to create a chart to look at different distributions in one picture

-to think what tau value for noise is reasonable. noise current mean could be bigger then what I'm using
