-to figure out how to save simulations
-to figure out how to save plots
-to store simulations results in a separate folder
-to save only spike times and minimal voltage for each interval + save plots of phase plane  and voltage trace in separate folders
-to check axis, labels etc.
-to make it possible to save all images together at once (for now it's ok to save only histograms)
-check if threshold is ok for different parameters - seems so
?to continue working with hists. Burst ISIs have the peak in the beginnig
-divide quiet ISIs into parts. look if we can neglect going to node time.
-axis, labels! min_volt_hist. node instead of min?

===Try to find fixed points! + separatrix (close to linear, so just find stable direction and prolong it). How to do it? Ask!
Its actually about how close separatrix is to the limit cycle

Why if we start from thresh  even without without noise everything is still going right????
staring h value changes a picture a lot! we have to come out with how to pick it (is it always in the same regime after running for some time? should be
3d plots?

to save the data


-to do str(weights) ordered right. now - 0.5 0 1
-is it possible to open existing pictures when parameters are called?
-to change try except to if

-maybe to create a chart to look at different distributions in one picture

-to think what tau value for noise is reasonable. noise current mean could be bigger then what I'm using
