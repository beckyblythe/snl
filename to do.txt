-to figure out how to save simulations
-to figure out how to save plots
-to store simulations results in a separate folder
-to save only spike times and minimal voltage for each interval + save plots of phase plane  and voltage trace in separate folders
-to check axis, labels etc.
-to make it possible to save all images together at once (for now it's ok to save only histograms)
-check if threshold is ok for different parameters - seems so
?to continue working with hists. Burst ISIs have the peak in the beginnig
-divide quiet ISIs into parts. look if we can neglect going to node time.
-axis, labels! min_volt_hist. node instead of min?
-J.-H. will give me a new 2D model. plot everything for it - see what happens!
-Rewrite everything with tau_n as a parameter, maybe it's the problem!
 No, timestep was the prolem
-approx separatrix doesn't work!
-Plot limit cycle and node and saddle as points.
--dependency!!! saddle on get_points, but find_points on saddle
Do not exactly node, but some area around it
-Simulate more data. Think about ISI division. Talk to J.-H. on monday
-to plot fraction of quiet as a function of tau, I. Maybe even distribution of burst in a row.
-try to find parameters, so that overall distribution looks bimodal!

-1000 multiplication for histograms. somehow needed for 153 1, check why. fix

-Spykeviewer. something doesn't work. maybe it's about units. check it.
-why with new dt I'm getting weird stuff close to zero in burst_ISIs?
-------------------------------------------------------------


-look at Jan-Hendrik's code
-Think about the title and the abstract
-Compare properly new results to old results
-Running simulations now with noise 2.5. maybe we can actually see proper bimodal stuff



-to think what tau value for noise is reasonable.
