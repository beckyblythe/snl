1.7 140 150 hard to switch from  quiet
	210 quiet dominates                     simulate longer
    150 70 hard to switch from quiet
        150 good
    158 150 looks good	 			---histogram
	120 					simulate longer
    160 150 looks good, 			simulate longer
    161 after saddle-node bifurcation
    

1.8 100 seems impossible to jump back from quiet area
    140 400 kinda works                         ---histogram
    150 seems impossible to jump from bursting with reasonable noise strength
    160 seems impossible to jump from bursting with reasonable noise strength   ?reasonable

1.9 140 400 not switching to quiet 
	1000 good

1.65 158 70 looks good 				---histogram

1.6 158 no limit cycle yet + something weird with the node and determination of min loop
	seems like 1.6 is before SNL bifurcation

1.64 first value after SNL bifurcation
     155 no limit cycle yet
     157 is the first with limit cycle 
     158 70 looks promising 			simulate for longer + saddle and node are really close!
         50 really good not that many bursts	simulate longer
	 30 seems impossible to jump from quiet
     160 70 promising
	 50 ok
	 30 2 switches from burst
     161 after saddle-node bifurcation


1.75 158 150 impossible to jump from bursting
	 170 still hard, 1 jump in 10 s
	 190 still hard

1.74 160 saddle and node are really close 
	 210 hard to switch to quiet
	 230 looks good
     158 190 4 switches
	 210 9 switches
     150 210 4 switches, but also hard to switch back
     140  210 simulate for longer 


try 1.75 ---find limits for Cm

try different currents where it works for some
